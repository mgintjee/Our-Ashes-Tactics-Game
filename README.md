#**Our-Ashes-Tactics-Game**
- Ambitious Game that has been in the works (At least conceptually) since 2012
- Strategy/Simulation Turn-based Hex Mech Game
- Comparable to Battletech/Battle Brothers but probs worse

# Goals:
- Similar to Battle Brothers in a lot of ways except with giant bro-bots
- Simulation capable (Allow idle play for those who want it)
- World map that is affected by player actions by expanding territory of factions (Need to make said world map)
- Similar inventory system like Destiny
